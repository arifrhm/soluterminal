#
# Shared Node interpreter resolver for every managed harness shortcut.
#
# The `deepseek`/`pi`/`pi-glm`/`zcode` commands in ~/.local/bin are tiny shims
# that exec this file with the interpreter path captured when the shortcut was
# written. That captured path is a snapshot: an nvm version can be upgraded or
# removed, or a home directory can be copied to another machine, and the old
# absolute path then stops resolving. Re-resolving here, instead of failing on
# the snapshot, keeps the command usable and, when nothing can run it, prints an
# actionable error instead of a bare `exec: ...: not found`.
#
# The order mirrors the daemon's resolveNodeBin (daemon/schedules_agent.go): the
# pinned interpreter, PATH, the asdf shim, the newest nvm/asdf install, then the
# user's login shell. Every candidate must also satisfy the provider's
# supported-Node gate: an executable but too-old pin (a distro /usr/bin/node,
# say) must not shadow the newer nvm/asdf install the user just added. The
# launcher cannot fall through to another interpreter once it is running, so the
# gate is probed here. Keep the probes in step with launch.mjs
# (nodeSupportsDsh / nodeSupportsPi).
#
# Usage: harness-shortcut.sh NODE LAUNCHER PROVIDER --data-dir DIR [ARGS...]
# Invoked by the generated shortcut, never by users.
