// Durable daemon logging.
//
// The daemon's stderr is whatever its launcher happened to attach, and every
// launcher gets this wrong in a different way:
//
//   - The WSL start script redirects the supervisor's stdout/stderr to
//     daemon.log. Useful, but only for processes the supervisor forked.
//   - A self-update successor is forked by the OUTGOING daemon, not by the
//     supervisor, so it does NOT inherit that redirect. spawnSuccessor points
//     it at <bindir>/successor.log instead — which is truncated by the next
//     update apply, sits next to the binary rather than with the other logs,
//     and is therefore not where anyone looks. That is how the 2026-08-16
//     exit read as zero evidence: daemon.log stops dead at the moment of the
//     update apply, and the successor's own words are somewhere else.
//   - A manual `solud` run logs to whatever terminal is attached, which is
//     gone by the time anyone asks what happened.
//
// So the daemon stops depending on its launcher and opens its own log. On
// boot it tees every slog record into an append-mode, size-rotated file it
// owns, and points the Go runtime's crash output at the same file so an
// UNRECOVERED panic — the one class of death the in-process crash reporter
// can never catch — writes its dying words somewhere that survives.
//
// This is additive: records still reach os.Stderr (supervisor redirect,
// systemd journal) and still land in the in-memory ring the crash reporter
// samples. Nothing that worked before stops working.

// durableLogMaxBytes caps the live log before it rotates. Matches the Tauri
// shell's DAEMON_LOG_MAX_BYTES so both halves of the same story age out at
// the same rate.
//
// The bound is "cap plus at most one record": a record is never split across
// a rotation, so a single oversized record lands whole in an empty live file
// and is rotated out by the next write. Splitting would corrupt the one thing
// this file exists to preserve — a JSON record or a panic traceback torn in
// half reads as garbage — so the record wins and the cap gives by one write.

// daemon.log keeps "where are the daemon logs?" to one answer per platform.
