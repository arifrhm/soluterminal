package main

// Claude Code CLI bootstrap: detect whether the `claude` binary exists in the
// environment panes actually run in, and whether it's authenticated, then
// surface that on GET /api/health so the web/native UI can guide install + auth
// instead of letting a Claude pane dead-end with "command not found".
//
// DESIGN (hardened after multi-agent review):
//   - Detection runs in a LOGIN SHELL, not exec.LookPath. The daemon inherits
//     the launcher's slim PATH (systemd/Tauri), so a bare LookPath misses
//     nvm-managed claude AND the native installer's ~/.local/bin. We reuse the
//     SAME init as pane spawning (loginShellInit) so detection and execution
//     agree by construction.
//   - The probe is CACHED. /api/health is a 10s heartbeat on a multiplexed
//     pipe; forking a shell per request would add latency to the reachability
//     signal. We probe at boot, on a slow ticker, after a guided install, and
//     when the setup checklist opens (a forced recheck) — never inside health().
//   - A probe FAILURE is not a probe ANSWER. Detection returns a three-way
//     claudeProbeOutcome; only found/absent (a shell that ran to completion)
//     may overwrite the cache. A timeout/exec error keeps the prior verdict —
//     a loaded post-auto-update boot must never flip a working install to
//     "not installed" and banner the user to install what they're running.
//   - Only DURABLE, UNCONTRADICTED absence may flip a confirmed install. Even a
//     correctly-observed absent can be transient: a Claude self-update removes
//     and re-creates the binary on disk, so for a window of seconds `command -v`
//     AND the disk cross-check both legitimately miss. An absent verdict is
//     therefore (1) contradicted by a binary on disk or a live claude process
//     (corroborateClaudeAbsent), and (2) damped by hysteresis — it must persist
//     across claudeAbsentConfirmProbes consecutive probes spanning
//     claudeAbsentConfirmWindow before installed:true flips (confirmClaudeAbsent).
//   - "Authenticated" is the presence of a valid LIVE credential file, the only
//     cheap, sound signal (accounts.length / active-name are ambiguous: a fresh
//     login is an unsaved live file; a stale pointer can outlive a deleted
//     file). macOS stores creds in the Keychain, not a file, so authed reads
//     false there — macOS auth is out of scope (we ship the Linux/WSL daemon).
